# merge-conflict-example-2
I guess you REALLY could NOT say this really was, a conflict, STUPIDLY merged. Its quite the contrary, but one can certainly try.

but, WHAT IF YOU consider the following, what if this merging, was possibly duplicated? The thought is.. terrifying, even i can't believe it..

What if instead of conflicting the merging we instead duplicated the conflict? WHO KNOWS!!! I DONT!!!
